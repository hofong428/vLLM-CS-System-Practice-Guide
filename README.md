4. Creating the Visual Diagram
To transform the above textual description into a visual diagram, follow these steps using a diagramming tool:

Choose a Tool: Select a diagramming tool such as Lucidchart, draw.io, Microsoft Visio, or Figma.

Define Symbols:

Rectangles: Represent each component (e.g., API Gateway, Authentication Service).
Arrows: Indicate the flow of data and interactions between components.
Containers: Use grouped shapes or containers to represent microservices and databases.
Layout Structure:

Top Layer: Client Layer (Web, Mobile, Chat)
Middle Layers:
API Gateway
Authentication Service
Session Management Service
Lower Middle Layer:
Business Logic Services
vLLM Service
Bottom Layer:
Databases
Monitoring & Logging
Side Components:
CI/CD Pipeline
Container Orchestration
Security Components
Optional Message Queue
Connect Components:

Draw arrows from the Client Layer to the API Gateway.
From API Gateway, draw arrows to Authentication Service, Session Management Service, and Business Logic Services.
Connect Business Logic Services to vLLM Service and Databases.
Link Monitoring & Logging, CI/CD Pipeline, and Container Orchestration appropriately to the services they monitor or deploy.
Ensure Security Components are linked to all relevant communication paths.
If using a Message Queue, connect it between Business Logic Services as needed.
Enhance Visual Clarity:

Use different colors to distinguish between types of services (e.g., frontend, backend, security).
Add labels and legends if necessary.
Incorporate icons representing different technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, databases).
